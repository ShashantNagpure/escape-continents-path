# escape-continents-path
This problem was a variation of Travelling Salesman Problem
I am using a greedy algorithm to solve the problem.
For selecting next city from any given city, it will select best shortest distance from cities in available continents.
This is not a global optimal solution, but works on minimizing local optimum
